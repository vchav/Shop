			<h1>Our Products</h1>
			<p>
				We have a vast selection of the most expensive and useless pet products you could possibly want. Jill's Pet Corral will not match any price, so don't even think about it. We are not responsible for the occasional snake that bursts into flames, or the rats that grow to 150 lbs. That was the other pet shop. No matter what that guy says, we are not related.

						<h2>Methane Booster Pills</h2>
						<p>
							We are all looking for ways to save money on gas. Jill's got a great deal on these Methane Booster Pills, which can improve mileage dramatically.  Just pop one down your pet's throat, and wait for the gas production to begin. Jill fed some of these to her ferret and got over 50 miles per gallon in her Suburban! Don't feed to your roommate. Not for use as a party favor. Rubber piping and gaskets required. To be installed by professional only. Your mileage may vary.  Void where prohibited. Results not typical. Do not use while smoking.

						<h2>Parrot Poop Stand</h2>		
						<p>
							Does your parrot suffer anxiety when it doesn't have a shoulder to poop on? Well, no longer!  This animatronic human is so convincing that Jill's mother adopted it and tried to feed it meatloaf for 10 years. Your parrot will really enjoy pooping all over this super-realistic stand.

						<h2>Salt-water Aquarium Gingerbread Men</h2>

						<p>These high-quality gingerbreads are perfect accessories for your salt-water aquarium. Squid love to play with these until they dissolve. After that, the critters don't move around very much so obviously they really enjoyed the play time.  Only takes a few hours to clean up after your squid finishes playing with them.</p>
